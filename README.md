# Closeme Window

This Python project is designed to improve Python skills by creating an evasive window that challenges the user to close it. The window moves away from the cursor whenever it gets too close, increasing its speed based on proximity. The project demonstrates basic GUI manipulation, event-driven programming, and screen boundary detection using libraries like [CustomTkinter](https://customtkinter.tomschimansky.com/).


## Libraries Used

- CustomTkinter: For the graphical user interface.
- PyAutoGUI: To track cursor position.
- Math: For distance and angle calculations.
